### what is Git?

- The major difference between Git and any other VCS 
 (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data.
 - Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem
- With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look 
  like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot
